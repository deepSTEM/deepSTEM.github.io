***This is a brief introduction of mine***

Hello! I am Bangyu Lan, a Computer Science Ph.D. student who loves reading, sports, coding, researching and other novel things! History and reading attract me most, because they teach me a real image of the world and reality, based on which I can explore and fulfill my dream.

After graduating from Harbin Institute of Technology, I am now attanding Rochester Institute of Technology to pursue a Ph.D. degree in several topics mainly in computer vision, generation, sequential model, etc. Details can be viewed in other websites. Most importantly, I am interested in the foundation and generality of machine intelligence. Hopefully my research journey can help me reveal this mystery.

If you are interested, you can contact me using this email bangyulan@163.com. I will publish my latest achievements or findings in this personal website. Any discussions, ideas and opportunities are all welcome.
